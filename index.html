          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>⭐ Travelling </p>
          <p> Travelling is my main passion. I have already visited half of Europe, USA. Next step is visiting South Asia and some islands in Carribean Sea. </p>
          <p>⭐ Football </p>
          <p> I am playing football all my life. I always try to watch as much football matches as I can. As fan of Barcelona FC and German National Football team, my dream is to visit some matches of both teams. </p>
          <p>⭐IT </p>
          <p> When I was studying at form 9, I faced with really difficult choise. I had to decide if I want to study IT, or to continue sudying in High Schhol.
          And I made a really bad desicion, because after few years I realized, how big is IT influence on our lives, and how important it became for our everyday life.
          So now I wasting all my free time and every evening I am sitting and studying. </p>
